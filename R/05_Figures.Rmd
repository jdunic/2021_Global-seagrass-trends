**Figure 1.** Global distribution of seagrass (green; data from UNEP-WCMC, Short 2021), with sites (n = 219) from 
Waycott *et al.* 2009 and additional sites (n = 323) from 
this study. Included are the seagrass bioregions adapted 
from Short et al. (2007): 1. Temperate North Pacific, 2. Temperate North 
Atlantic West, 3. Temperate North Atlantic East, 4. Tropical Atlantic, 
5. Mediterranean, 6. Tropical Indo-Pacific, 7. Temperate Southern Oceans.

**Figure 2.** Bioregional trends in seagrass meadow area over time, estimated 
using bioregion-specific generalised additive models. Mean meadow area is 
expressed as a proportion of the meadow area observed in the initial surveys, 
averaged across sites for each bioregion, and on a log~10~ scale, such that a 
change from 1 to 0.1 equals a 10-fold decrease in seagrass area over time. 
The shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals of the GAM fits. The number of meadows 
sampled in each decade are shown in grey at the bottom of each panel. The 
bioregional trend in the Mediterranean does not include 16 sites that contained 
only two sampled time points.

**Figure 3.** Status of seagrass meadows over time and across bioregions. 
Each point represents one seagrass meadow and point size represents the 
maximum area ever observed for that meadow. The x-axis indicates the size of a 
meadow at the beginning of a decade (e.g., 1990), as estimated using the 
bioregional GAMs, relative to the maximum area ever observed at that meadow. 
The y-axis is the instantaneous annual rate of change (%) in meadow area during 
a decade. This axis has been transformed using the signed pseudo logarithm 
(sigma = 0.5, base = 10) to improve visualisation of the high number of meadows 
with rates of change less than 10%. As values increase above 10, this axis 
approximates a log~10~ scale.

The methods are described in Table 1 and are shown in order of strength of attribution.

change in seagrass meadow area. Examples of specific drivers considered in each 
driver category are detailed in Table S2.
