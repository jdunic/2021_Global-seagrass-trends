**Figure S3.** Global size distribution of net losses (red, left) and net gains 
(blue, right). Net change in meadow extent (y-axis) is log~10~-scaled and number 
of meadows is on the x-axis. Each point represents the net change in a meadow 
over its entire time series (area~final~ – area~initial~). To demonstrate the 
difference in magnitude of net change between small and large extents, point 
size corresponds to net change in area in a near-linear fashion.

**Figure S4.** Bioregional trends in seagrass areal extent over time, estimated 
using bioregion specific generalised additive models. The shaded areas represent 
95% confidence intervals of the GAM fits. The same data are presented as in 
Figure 2 but axes are fixed across bioregions to highlight differences in 
magnitude of trends in seagrass areal extent and the length of time-series. 
Mean proportion of change is scaled to the initial values estimated for each 
bioregion and on a log~10~ scale, such that a change from 1 to 0.1 equals a 
10-fold decrease in seagrass area over time.

**Figure S6.** Size distribution of net losses (red, left) and net gains 
(blue, right) across bioregions. Net change in meadow area (y-axis) is 
log~10~-scaled and number of meadows is on the x-axis. Each point represents the 
net change in a meadow over its entire time series (area~final~ – area~initial~). 
To demonstrate the difference in magnitude of net change between small and large 
areas, point size corresponds to net change in area in a near-linear fashion.

**Figure S7.** Status of all seagrass meadows in all decades.
Each point represents one seagrass meadow in a decade and point size represents 
the maximum area ever observed for that meadow. The x-axis indicates the size of 
a meadow at the beginning of a decade (e.g., 1990), as estimated using the 
bioregional GAMs, relative to the maximum area ever observed at that meadow. 
The y-axis is the instantaneous annual rate of change (%) in meadow area during 
a decade. This axis has been transformed using the signed pseudo logarithm 
(sigma = 0.5, base = 10) to improve visualisation of the high number of meadows 
with rates of change less than 10%. As values increase above 10, this axis 
approximates a log~10~ scale.

**Figure S8.** Comparison of the relationship between the absolute annual rate of 
change (%) and fraction of maximum ever observed area between meadows that 
experienced losses and those that experienced gains. Each point represents one 
seagrass meadow in a decade and point size represents.

**Figure S9.** Status of seagrass meadows split into four size bins of maximum 
observed meadow size (< 10 ha, 10 – 100 ha, 100 – 1000 ha, > 1000 ha). Each dot 
represents one seagrass meadow, with size representing the maximum areal extent 
observed at that meadow over its entire time series and colour indicating the 
bioregion. The x-axis indicates the size of a meadow in a decade, as estimated 
using the bioregional GAMs, relative to the maximum size ever observed in the 
time series of that meadow. Rate of change (%) in meadow areal extent, shown on 
the y-axis, has been transformed using the signed pseudo logarithm 
(sigma = 0.5, base = 10)

**Figure S10.** Relationship between coefficient of variation of each meadow 
extent time-series and the maximum observed meadow size. The coefficient of 
variation was calculated for each meadow as the standard deviation of observed 
meadow sizes divided by the mean observed meadow size.

**Figure S13.** Status of seagrass meadows over time and across bioregions 
comparing the sites found in this study (green) and sites first included in 
Waycott et al. (2009; orange). Each point represents the status of one seagrass 
meadow in a given decade, while and point size represents the maximum area ever 
observed for that meadow. Meadows that have experienced more severe losses will 
be farther on the left of a panel; meadows near their maximum size will be on 
the right (near vertical line, x = 1); and stable/slowly changing meadows are 
near the horizontal line, y = 0. The x-axis indicates the size of a meadow at 
the beginning of a decade (e.g., 1990), as estimated using the bioregional GAMs, 
relative to the maximum area ever observed at that meadow. The y-axis is the 
instantaneous annual rate of change (%) in meadow area during a decade. Note 
that the y-axis varies in range across the bioregions and has been transformed 
using the signed pseudo logarithm (sigma = 0.5, base = 10) to improve 
visualisation of the high number of meadows with rates of change less than 10%. 
As values increase above 10, this axis approximates a log10 scale.
